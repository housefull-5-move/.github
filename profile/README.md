## 🎬 Plot & Theme *(Rumored)*

After four films of chaotic weddings and family madness, *Housefull 5* might shift gears into a **globe-trotting spy adventure** where the core cast (Akshay Kumar, Riteish Deshmukh, etc.) accidentally get entangled in an **international conspiracy**. Think:

- 🎯 *Mission: Impossible* meets *Golmaal* – Mistaken identities, high-tech gadgets, and over-the-top action  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **A "Housefull" of Spies** – The gang is wrongly identified as elite undercover agents, leading to hilarious yet dangerous missions  
- 🧨 **Villain Twist** – A powerful billionaire (possibly played by *John Abraham* or *Bobby Deol*) is the mastermind behind a global threat
